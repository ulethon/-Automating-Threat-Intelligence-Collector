# Automating Threat Intelligence Collection

## Project Overview

Automating Threat Intelligence Collection is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the collection and analysis of cyber threat intelligence. The tool automates the process of gathering threat data from various sources such as open-source threat intelligence feeds, APIs, and websites. This project helps organizations efficiently gather relevant threat data to enhance their cybersecurity posture.

### Features
- **Automatic Data Collection**: Pulls threat intelligence data from various public and private APIs.
- **Threat Feed Integration**: Supports popular threat intelligence feeds like VirusTotal, AlienVault, and more.
- **Data Processing**: Cleanse, format, and analyze the collected data for insights.
- **Reports Generation**: Generate custom reports based on collected threat intelligence.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable to add new data sources or features.

### Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- Requests library for making HTTP requests
- JSON for data handling
- Custom parsing modules for threat intelligence analysis
